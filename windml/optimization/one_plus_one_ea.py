        A (1+1)-EA for real parameter optimization of an algorithm. Does
        not adapt step size, the choice of sigma is therefore very important.

        parameter: the name of the real parameter to minimize
        mean: mean of population and start position respectively
        sigma: step size of the evolution process
        interval: feasible interval of parameter solutions
        iterations: how many iteration until termination
        args: hashmap of the arguments of algorithm
        algorithm: the algorithm function to optimize, the function
        needs to accept the args hashmap.
